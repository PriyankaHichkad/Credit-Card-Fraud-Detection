# Credit Card Fraud Detection

> A practical machine learning project to detect fraudulent credit card transactions  
> *‚ÄúWhen data speaks, fraud gets caught.‚Äù*

---

## Project Overview:

This repository contains my end-to-end pipeline for detecting **credit card fraud** using machine learning models. The objective is to identify fraudulent transactions from real financial data while overcoming challenges such as extreme class imbalance and anonymized features.

[CODE](https://github.com/PriyankaHichkad/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection/blob/main/Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb)

## Tech Stack-

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn (ML models, metrics, pipelines)
- ML Models (Logistic regression , Support Vector Machine, K Nearest Neighbours, Decision Trees)
- Metric (Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC-AUC Curve)
- Optuna and GridSearchCV (Advanced hyperparameter optimization)
- Data Visualisation , Exploratory Data Analysis , Data Science application in Finance , Machine Learning
- Jupyter Notebook

## Why This Project?

Credit card fraud is a growing threat, impacting millions globally. The ability to detect and stop fraud in real-time is critical for financial institutions. This project was a hands-on opportunity to:

- Work with real-world, highly imbalanced financial data
- Apply machine learning models for classification
- Explore model tuning and interpretability
- Strengthen data preprocessing and EDA skills

## Dataset Information:

- üìÅ **Source**: [Kaggle ‚Äì Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- üìå **Timeframe**: Transactions from two days in September 2013
- üßÆ **Records**: 284,807 transactions; 492 are fraudulent (‚âà 0.172%)
- üîê **Features**: 30 total ‚Äî `Time`, `Amount`, `V1` to `V28` (PCA-transformed), `Class` (Target)

---

## Steps Followed in the Project-

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Studied distributions of `Amount`, `Time`, and PCA components.
- Compared feature distributions between fraud and non-fraud classes.
- Visualized class imbalance and transaction trends.

### 2. Data Preprocessing:
- **Scaled** the `Amount` and `Time` features using `StandardScaler` and `MinMaxScaler`.
- **Removed outliers** based on IQR method to ensure model stability.
- **Handled class imbalance** by focusing on recall and precision-recall AUC instead of overall accuracy.

### 3. Dimensionality Reduction:
- Visualized data using **PCA, T-SNE and TruncatedSVD** to understand cluster separation.
- Ensured interpretability while retaining data integrity.

### 4. Model Building:
Applied and compared the performance of:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**

Each model was trained and validated using stratified train-test split to preserve class ratios.

### 5. Hyperparameter Tuning:
- Utilized `GridSearchCV` and `Optuna` for optimizing hyperparameters.
- Tuned parameters such as `C`, `kernel`, `n_neighbors`, etc.

### 6. Model Evaluation:
- Evaluation metrics included:
  - **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-Score**
  - **Confusion Matrix**
  - **ROC Curve**
  - **Precision-Recall AUC (AUPRC)**

## Key Results-


---

## Challenges Faced-

- **Severe Class Imbalance**: Made conventional accuracy meaningless ‚Äî had to rely on AUC-ROC.
- **Outlier Sensitivity**: Required careful preprocessing to prevent misclassification.
- **PCA Transformed Features**: Limited feature interpretability, making EDA less intuitive.

---

## Future Improvements-

- Implement ensemble models like **Random Forest** or **XGBoost**
- Try **SMOTE** or **undersampling techniques** for resampling
- Develop an interactive dashboard using **Streamlit** or **Dash**
- Simulate real-time scoring with live transaction data
